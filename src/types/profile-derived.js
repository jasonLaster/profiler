/**
 * Contains a table of function call information that represents the stacks of what

 * frames for a single function call. Using stacks as opposed to a computed tree of
 * CallNodes can cause duplicated functions in the call tree.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *            stack1 (funcA)                             callNode1 (funcA)

 *            /            \                                    |
 *           V              V                                   v
 *    stack4 (funcD)     stack5 (funcD)                  callNode4 (funcD)
